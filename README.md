## Sequential-Analysis
### B.Tech Project 2017
#### Abstractâ€”Single gene experiments are assays for querying ribonucleic acid species abundance in individual or pools of cells and have enormous importance in varied fields like evolution, pathology and drug development. However, these experiments are usually performed by pre-specifying the sample size during experimental design, which may lead to underpowered or overpowered hypothesis tests. Recently, for the two-stage experimental design framework, algorithms like [SCOTTY](http://scotty.genetics.utah.edu/) have been proposed. Due to some disadvantages, we extend this approach by proposing sequential experimental design framework for a single gene experiment. We show how experimental cost can be optimally allocated with respect to maximizing power for particular costconstraints for such experiments. We are presently in the process of developing a toolkit that can be easily used to perform gene abundance assays.

#### NOTE : Phase-1 is complete as on Apr-30 2017, Phase-2 (multiple gene scenario) is under progress.
